# WhyPadOS

WhyPadOS (stylized as whyPadOS) is an open source recreation of Apple's iPadOS (spanning from versions 13 to 16). It is part of the WacOS operating system project. 

| [**Predecessor:** `(wOS 12)`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/wOS_12) [`(Local`)](/) | [**Successor:** `(Incumbent`)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WhyPadOS) [`(Local)`](/WhyPadOS/) |
|---|---|

## Language

The system is currently written in C, but will also support several other languages, including x86 Assembly, Swift, Objective-C, Objective-C++, and AppleScript, and more.

### Programming language support

C starts at version C11

Assembly is x86 Assembly

Objective-C starts at version 2.0

Objective-C++ starts at version ??

AppleScript starts at version 2.5

Swift starts at version 2.0

Metal starts at version ??

## Feature translation notes

The exact system requirements are not a forced emulation option. The WacOS system is designed to be lighter, but you can adjust it to match MacOS.

WacOS equivalents of programs are included.

Malicious methods (such as DRM/TPM) are NEVER included with WacOS, not even as an open source recreation.

Please [raise an issue](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/issues/) if any other clarification is needed.
